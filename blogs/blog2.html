        <div class="discription">
            <p>A visual studio code is a lightweight software application with a powerful source code editor that runs on the desktop. It is a free source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Mac OS and Linux. It is a software editor that has a rich extension of various languages like C++, C+, C, Java, Python, PHP, Go, etc. and runtime language extensions such as .NET and Unity. It is easy to edit, build, syntax highlighting, snippets, code refactoring and debugging. In visual studio code, we can change the application's background theme, keyboard shortcuts set on our preferences, install an extension and add additional functionality.</p>

        <div class="steps">
            <ol>
                <li> We should have a basic knowledge of C programming.</li>
                <li>The Visual Studio Code Editor must be installed in the system.</li>
                <li>Download the C/C++ Extension. It is an extension provided by Microsoft that support visual studio code. It helps in IntelliSence, debugging and code browsing of the programming code in the visual studio.</li>
                <li>Download the C/C++ compilers. There are some popular compilers are:
                    <ol>
                        <li>GCC on Linux</li>
                        <li>GCC via Mingw-w64 on Windows</li>
                        <li>Microsoft C++ compiler on windows</li>
                        <li>Clang for XCode on MacOS</li>
